♥ If you’re curious whether I’m serious about this—
Here’s a short excerpt from the paper I’m writing.
(Yes, I’m that kind of philosopher.)

Traditionally, empathy has been defined based on the subject’s perspective—my understanding, my reaction to another’s suffering.
Levinas, for example, saw empathy as a moral responsibility before the Other: a call to respond ethically to their pain.

My theory—Object-Centered Empathy—inherits this concern,
but reframes the structure of empathy to include not just the intention of the “feeling-giver,”
but also the response of the one who feels it.

In this view, empathy can occur without intention,
so long as the one receiving it—the object—has a real emotional response.

Empathy is not only about whether I understood,
but whether something was felt.
That feeling, that existential response, becomes a condition for empathy itself.

Emotions are subjective by nature.
But in Object-Centered Empathy,
that subjectivity isn’t a flaw—
it’s the very starting point of moral recognition.
